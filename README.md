I'm sorry, I optimized for delivery speed, not readability. This project was very experimental.

## Important todos for next year

- Implement clock synchronization, like [Cristian's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian%27s_algorithm).
- Review the colors used. [reference](https://www.youtube.com/live/feULovk98Yo?si=koM9D1hKouaIOrIm&t=5032)

## Needed software

- Node.js 22
- Go 1.25.0
- Docker
- kubectl and Helm
